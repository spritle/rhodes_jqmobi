# jqMobi - a HTML5 targeted Javascript Framework

jqMobi is a Javascript framework targeted at HTML5 browsers with a blazingly fast query selector library that supports W3C queries.  

It is comprised of three parts.

1) jqMobi  - query selector library

2) jqUi - UI/UX library for mobile applications in a webkit browser.  Please see the Kitchen Sink folder for a demo

3) jqPlugins - plugins for mobile applications in a webkit browser.

# About jqMobi

While doing mobile development, we quickly found there was no place for the famous query selector libraries.  They often performed poorly, were large in size, and targeted legacy desktop browsers (IE6).  There were a few new libraries targeting mobile development, but speed tests showed they actually performed worse.

We started talking to our development community and asked them what they wanted.  The key features were

1. Fast performance

2. Small code base

3. Only needs to support a small subset of commands

Rather then try to improve another library, we found it easier to build one from the ground up, but recognizing the groundwork other frameworks laid out.  By doing this, we were able to identify simple ways to increase speed performance.  Our tests repeatedly showed we were 2x or more faster at single operation commands. 
 
All the libraries performed similar when operations were performed on a group of elements.


# Using jqMobi

To use jqMobi, include the script in your html file.  You can use the pre-built minified version.

``` js
<script src="jq.mobi.min.js"></script>
```

This will then create two objects that you can work with.  It will NOT override a pre-existing $ object.
``` js
$("#main")
jq("#main")
```

# Query Selector

W3C spec'ed queries are supported.  What this means is you can do the following

``` js
$("input[type='text']")
```

You can NOT do the following, as it's not supported by the browsers.

``` js
$("input:text")
```

In some functions, an additional selector can be used.  This can be a string, array, or a jqMobi object.  We currently do not support functions



# Syntax:

Basic call

``` js
$("#id").hide()
```

You can specify a Dom element, selector, list of nodes, or HTML string.	

``` js
$("span").bind("click",function(){console.log("clicked");}); // -> find all span elements and attach a click event
```
You can pass in an HTML string and it will create the object for you.

``` js
var myDiv=$("<div id='foo'>") //Creates a div object and returns it
```

# jqMobi API functions - Please see http://api.jqmobi.com for all functions
``` js

.remove() //Remove an element from the Dom
.addClass("className") //Adds the css clas name to the selected elements
.removeClass("className") //Removes a css class from the selected elements
.hasClass("className")  //Checks the first element to see if the css class exists
.hasClass("className",_element)  //Checks the passed in element to see if the css class exists
.bind("event",function(){}) //Binds a function to the event listener selected to the selected elements
.unbind("event") //Unbinds a function to the event listener selected to the selected elements
.trigger("event",data) //Trigger an event on the selected elements and pass in optional data
.one(event,callback)//Bind an event to happen only once
.delegate(selector,event,callback)  //delegate an event listener for the selectors
.undelegate(selector,event,callback) //remove the delegate listener
.on(event,selector,callback) //same as delegate, just different param orders
.off(event,selector,callback) //remove the on listener
.append(element) //Appends an element to the selected elements
.prepend() //Prepends an element to the selected elements
.get() //Returns the first element from the selected elements
.get(2) //Returns the third element from the selected elements 
.offset() //Calculates the first elements offset on the screen
.data(param,value)// Sets a data-* attribute for the param
.data(param) //Gets a data-* attribute for the param

```

# jqMobi Ajax calls

``` js

.get(url,callback) //Makes an Ajax request to the URL and executes the callback funtion with the result
.post(url,data,callback,dataType) //Makes an Ajax POST request to the URL with the data and executes the callback with the result.  An optional dataType can be passed in, as some webservices require the header
.getJSON(url,data,callback) //Makes an ajax request with the data and executes callback function passing in a JSON object from the Ajax response into the callback function.
```
If you need more access, you can use the following.

``` js
.ajax {
   type:'POST', //defaults to GET
   url:'/api/getinfo', //defaults to window.location
   contentType:'application/json', //defaults to application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   headers:{},
   dataType:'application/json', //defaults to text/html
   data:{username:foo}, //Can be a Key/Value pair string or object.  If it's an object, $.serialize is called to turn it into a Key/Value pair string
   success:function(data){}, //function to call on successful Ajax request
   error:function(data){}, //function to call when an error exists in the Ajax request
}
```

If the url contains the pattern =? in it, a jsonP request will be made.  These can ONLY be GET requests

# jqMobi Helper calls
``` js
.param() //Serialize a JSON object into KVP for a querystring
.parseJSON(string) //Backwards compatability JSON parsing call.  Uses the browsers native JSON parser
.parseXML(string) //Parses a string and returns a XML document version
```

# jqMobi OS detectors

``` js
$.os.webkit     //True if webkit found in the user agent
$.os.android    //True if anroid useragent
$.os.ipad       //True if iPad useragent
$.os.iphone     //True if iPhone user agent
$.os.webos      //True if WebOS detected
$.os.touchpad   //True if WebOS and Touchpad user agent
$.os.ios        //True if iPad or iPhone
$.os.blackberry //True if Blackberry PlayBook or OS >=6
```

# Plugins

jqMobi is built with the extendability to add plugins.  To create a plugin, you will most likely extend the $.fn object by passing a reference of the main jqMobi object

``` js

(function($){
  $.fn['foo']=function(){
     alert("bar");
  }
})(jq);

```
